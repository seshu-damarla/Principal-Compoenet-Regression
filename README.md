# Principal-Compoenet-Regression
Principal component regression for developing soft sensor for debutanizer column used in refnery.
A debutanizer column is a part of several processing units in a refinery. Wherever there is production of LPG and gasoline e.g. in the atmospheric and vacuum crude distillation unit, cracking and coking units, the debutanizer column is used to remove the lighter fractions from gasoline. The feed to the debutanizer column is the unstabilized naphtha and the products coming out from the column are LPG as the top product and gasoline/stabilized naphtha as the bottom product.

For improved process performance, the butane (C4) content in the bottom product should be minimized. This requires continuous monitoring of C4 content in the bottom product. A gas chromatograph is used in the process for this purpose. However, the hardware sensor (gas chromatograph) is not installed in the bottom flow line coming from the debutanizer column and instead is located in the overhead of the deisopentanizer column which is located some distance away from the debutanizer column. This introduces a time delay in measurement which is of the order of 30â€“75 min. Therefore, a soft sensor can be used in the bottom flow of the debutanizer column to overcome the time delay problem of the hardware sensor. The output to be predicted by the soft sensor model is the C4 content present in the debutanizer column bottom product. This output depends on seven process inputs as has been reported in the literature. The seven process inputs and the output quality variable to be estimated by the soft sensor are mentioned in Table. The location of sensors for the seven process inputs, the gas chromatograph used for C4 content measurement and the proposed soft sensor are shown in Figure.

PCR based soft sensor is created to estimate the quality variable.
